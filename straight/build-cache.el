COMMAND must be an interactive function or lambda form.

KEYMAP, if present, should be a keymap variable or symbol.

a key should be bound. It must return non-nil in such cases.

Usage:

  (use-package package-name
     [:keyword [option]]...)

:init            Code to run before PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.
:config          Code to run after PACKAGE-NAME has been loaded.  Note that
                 if loading is deferred for any reason, this code does not
                 execute until the lazy load has occurred.
:preface         Code to be run before everything except `:disabled'; this
                 can be used to define functions for use in `:if', or that
                 should be seen by the byte-compiler.

:mode            Form to be added to `auto-mode-alist'.
:magic           Form to be added to `magic-mode-alist'.
:magic-fallback  Form to be added to `magic-fallback-mode-alist'.
:interpreter     Form to be added to `interpreter-mode-alist'.

:commands        Define autoloads for commands that will be defined by the
                 package.  This is useful if the package is being lazily
                 loaded, and you wish to conditionally call functions in your
                 `:init' block that are defined in the package.
:autoload        Similar to :commands, but it for no-interactive one.
:hook            Specify hook(s) to attach this package to.

:bind            Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands.
:bind*           Bind keys, and define autoloads for the bound commands,
                 *overriding all minor mode bindings*.
:bind-keymap     Bind a key prefix to an auto-loaded keymap defined in the
                 package.  This is like `:bind', but for keymaps.
:bind-keymap*    Like `:bind-keymap', but overrides all minor mode bindings

:defer           Defer loading of a package -- this is implied when using
                 `:commands', `:bind', `:bind*', `:mode', `:magic', `:hook',
                 `:magic-fallback', or `:interpreter'.  This can be an integer,
                 to force loading after N seconds of idle time, if the package
                 has not already been loaded.
:demand          Prevent the automatic deferred loading introduced by constructs
                 such as `:bind' (see `:defer' for the complete list).

:after           Delay the effect of the use-package declaration
                 until after the named libraries have loaded.
                 Before they have been loaded, no other keyword
                 has any effect at all, and once they have been
                 loaded it is as if `:after' was not specified.

:if EXPR         Initialize and load only if EXPR evaluates to a non-nil value.
:disabled        The package is ignored completely if this keyword is present.
:defines         Declare certain variables to silence the byte-compiler.
:functions       Declare certain functions to silence the byte-compiler.
:load-path       Add to the `load-path' before attempting to load the package.
:diminish        Support for diminish.el (if installed).
:delight         Support for delight.el (if installed).
:custom          Call `Custom-set' or `set-default' with each variable
                 definition without modifying the Emacs `custom-file'.
                 (compare with `custom-set-variables').
:custom-face     Call `custom-set-faces' with each face definition.
:ensure          Loads the package using package.el if necessary.
:pin             Pin the package to an archive.
:vc              Install the package directly from a version control system
                 (using `package-vc.el').

POSITION can be:
1. An integer, meaning point position.
2. A cons of two integers, meaning absolute X and Y coordinates.
3. Other type, in which case the corresponding POSHANDLER should be
   provided.

 (2) POSHANDLER

POSHANDLER is a function of one argument returning an actual
position.  Its argument is a plist of the following form:

  (:position xxx
   :poshandler xxx
   :font-height xxx
   :font-width xxx
   :posframe xxx
   :posframe-width xxx
   :posframe-height xxx
   :posframe-buffer xxx

   :parent-window-end xxx
   :parent-window-left xxx
   :parent-window-top xxx

   :mode-line-height  xxx
   :header-line-height xxx
   :tab-line-height xxx
   :x-pixel-offset xxx
   :y-pixel-offset xxx)

By default, poshandler is auto-selected based on the type of POSITION,
but the selection can be overridden using the POSHANDLER argument.

The builtin poshandler functions are listed below:

1.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-center'
2.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-center'
3.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-corner'
4.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-right-corner'
5.  `posframe-poshandler-frame-top-left-or-right-other-corner'

9.  `posframe-poshandler-window-center'
10.  `posframe-poshandler-window-top-center'
11. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-left-corner'
12. `posframe-poshandler-window-top-right-corner'
13. `posframe-poshandler-window-bottom-center'

19. `posframe-poshandler-point-window-center'
20. `posframe-poshandler-point-frame-center'

 (3) POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO

POSHANDLER-EXTRA-INFO is a plist, which will prepend to the
argument of poshandler function: `info', it will *OVERRIDE* the
exist key in `info'.

 (4) BUFFER-OR-NAME

This posframe's buffer is BUFFER-OR-NAME, which can be a buffer
or a name of a (possibly nonexistent) buffer.

buffer name can prefix with space, for example \" *mybuffer*\", so
the buffer name will hide for ibuffer and `list-buffers'.

 (5) NO-PROPERTIES

If NO-PROPERTIES is non-nil, The STRING's properties will
be removed before being shown in posframe.

 (6) HEIGHT, MAX-HEIGHT, MIN-HEIGHT, WIDTH, MAX-WIDTH and MIN-WIDTH

These arguments are specified in the canonical character width
and height of posframe, more details can be found in docstring of
function `fit-frame-to-buffer',

 (7) LEFT-FRINGE and RIGHT-FRINGE

If LEFT-FRINGE or RIGHT-FRINGE is a number, left fringe or
right fringe with be shown with the specified width.

 (8) BORDER-WIDTH, BORDER-COLOR, INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR

By default, posframe shows no borders, but users can specify
borders by setting BORDER-WIDTH to a positive number.  Border
color can be specified by BORDER-COLOR.

INTERNAL-BORDER-WIDTH and INTERNAL-BORDER-COLOR are same as
BORDER-WIDTH and BORDER-COLOR, but do not suggest to use for the
reason:

   Add distinct controls for child frames' borders (Bug#45620)
   http://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/emacs.git/commit/?id=ff7b1a133bfa7f2614650f8551824ffaef13fadc

 (9) FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR

Posframe's font as well as foreground and background colors are
derived from the current frame by default, but can be overridden
using the FONT, FOREGROUND-COLOR and BACKGROUND-COLOR arguments,
respectively.

 (10) CURSOR, TTY-NON-SELECTED-CURSOR and WINDOW-POINT

By default, cursor is not showed in posframe, user can let cursor
showed with this argument help by set its value to a `cursor-type'.

TTY-NON-SELECTED-CURSOR will let redisplay put the terminal
cursor in a non-selected frame, which is useful when use
vertico-posframe like package in tty.

When cursor need to be showed in posframe, user may need to set
WINDOW-POINT to the point of BUFFER, which can let cursor showed
at this point.

 (11) RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE

By default, posframe will display no header-line, mode-line and
tab-line.  In case a header-line, mode-line or tab-line is
desired, users can set RESPECT-HEADER-LINE and RESPECT-MODE-LINE
to t.

 (12) INITIALIZE

INITIALIZE is a function with no argument.  It will run when
posframe buffer is first selected with `with-current-buffer'
in `posframe-show', and only run once (for performance reasons).

 (13) LINES-TRUNCATE

If LINES-TRUNCATE is non-nil, then lines will truncate in the
posframe instead of wrap.

 (14) OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS

OVERRIDE-PARAMETERS is very powful, *all* the valid frame parameters
used by posframe's frame can be overridden by it.

NOTE: some `posframe-show' arguments are not frame parameters, so they
can not be overrided by this argument.

 (15) TIMEOUT

TIMEOUT can specify the number of seconds after which the posframe
will auto-hide.

 (15) REFRESH

If REFRESH is a number, posframe's frame-size will be re-adjusted
every REFRESH seconds.

 (17) ACCEPT-FOCUS

When ACCEPT-FOCUS is non-nil, posframe will accept focus.
be careful, you may face some bugs when set it to non-nil.

 (18) HIDEHANDLER

HIDEHANDLER is a function, when it return t, posframe will be
hide, this function has a plist argument:

  (:posframe-buffer xxx
   :posframe-parent-buffer xxx)

The builtin hidehandler functions are listed below:

1. `posframe-hidehandler-when-buffer-switch'

 (19) REFPOSHANDLER

REFPOSHANDLER is a function, a reference position (most is
top-left of current frame) will be returned when call this
function.

when it is nil or it return nil, child-frame feature will be used
and reference position will be deal with in Emacs.

The user case I know at the moment is let ivy-posframe work well
in EXWM environment (let posframe show on the other application
window).

         DO NOT USE UNLESS NECESSARY!!!

An example parent frame poshandler function is:

1. `posframe-refposhandler-xwininfo'

 (19) Others

You can use `posframe-delete-all' to delete all posframes.

The initial input is given by the INITIAL argument.  DIR can be nil, a

is called interactively with a prefix argument, the user can specify the
directories or files to search in.  Multiple directories or files must
be separated by comma in the minibuffer, since they are read via
`completing-read-multiple'.  By default the project directory is used if
`consult-project-function' is defined and returns non-nil.  Otherwise
the `default-directory' is searched.  If the command is invoked with a
double prefix argument (twice `C-u') the user is asked for a project, if
not yet inside a project, or the current project is searched.

The input string is split, the first part of the string (grep input) is
passed to the asynchronous grep process and the second part of the
string is passed to the completion-style filtering.

The input string is split at a punctuation character, which is given as
the first character of the input string.  The format is similar to
Perl-style regular expressions, e.g., /regexp/.  Furthermore command
line options can be passed to grep, specified behind --.  The overall
prompt input has the form `#async-input -- grep-opts#filter-string'.

Note that the grep input string is transformed from Emacs regular
expressions to Posix regular expressions.  Always enter Emacs regular
expressions at the prompt.  `consult-grep' behaves like builtin Emacs
search commands, e.g., Isearch, which take Emacs regular expressions.
Furthermore the asynchronous input split into words, each word must
match separately and in any order.  See `consult--regexp-compiler' for
the inner workings.  In order to disable transformations of the grep
input, adjust `consult--regexp-compiler' accordingly.

Here we give a few example inputs:

#alpha beta         : Search for alpha and beta in any order.
#alpha.*beta        : Search for alpha before beta.
#\\(alpha\\|beta\\) : Search for alpha or beta (Note Emacs syntax!)

If BUFFER-LOCAL is non-nil, the spinner will be automatically
deactivated if the buffer is killed.  If BUFFER-LOCAL is a
buffer, use that instead of current buffer.

When started, in order to function properly, the spinner runs a
timer which periodically calls `force-mode-line-update' in the
current buffer.  If BUFFER-LOCAL was set at creation time, then
`force-mode-line-update' is called in that buffer instead.  When
the spinner is stopped, the timer is deactivated.

DELAY, if given, is the number of seconds to wait after starting
the spinner before actually displaying it. It is safe to cancel
the spinner before this time, in which case it won't display at
all.

If you call `async-send' from a child process, the message will
be also passed to the FINISH-FUNC.  You can test RESULT to see if
it is a message by using `async-message-p'.  If nil, it means
this is the final result.  Example of the FINISH-FUNC:

    (lambda (result)
      (if (async-message-p result)
          (message \"Received a message from child process: %s\" result)
        (message \"Async process done, result: %s\" result)))

If FINISH-FUNC is nil or missing, a future is returned that can
be inspected using `async-get', blocking until the value is
ready.  Example:

    (let ((proc (async-start
                   ;; What to do in the child process
                   (lambda ()

        (message \"Waiting on async process, result should be 222: %s\"
                 (async-get proc)))

If you don't want to use a callback, and you don't care about any
return value from the child process, pass the `ignore' symbol as
the second argument (if you don't, and never call `async-get', it
will leave *emacs* process buffers hanging around):

    (async-start
     (lambda ()
       (delete-file \"a remote file on a slow link\" nil))
     \\='ignore)

Special case:
If the output of START-FUNC is a string with properties
e.g. (buffer-string) RESULT will be transformed in a list where the
car is the string itself (without props) and the cdr the rest of
properties, this allows using in FINISH-FUNC the string without
properties and then apply the properties in cdr to this string (if
needed).
Properties handling special objects like markers are returned as
list to allow restoring them later.
See <https://github.com/jwiegley/emacs-async/issues/145> for more infos.

Note: Even when FINISH-FUNC is present, a future is still
returned except that it yields no value (since the value is
passed to FINISH-FUNC).  Call `async-get' on such a future always
returns nil.  It can still be useful, however, as an argument to

 or

(&optional sources input prompt resume preselect

** Keywords

Keywords supported:

- :sources
- :input
- :prompt
- :resume
- :preselect
- :buffer
- :keymap
- :default
- :history
- :allow-nest

Extra LOCAL-VARS keywords are supported, see the \"** Other
keywords\" section below.

Basic keywords are the following:

*** :sources

One of the following:

- List of sources
- Symbol whose value is a list of sources
- Alist representing a Helm source.
  - In this case the source has no name and is referenced in
    `helm-sources' as a whole alist.

*** :input

Initial input of minibuffer (temporary value of `helm-pattern')

*** :prompt

Minibuffer prompt. Default value is `helm--prompt'.

*** :resume

If t, allow resumption of the previous session of this Helm
command, skipping initialization.

If \\='noresume, this instance of `helm' cannot be resumed.

*** :preselect

Initially selected candidate (string or regexp).

*** :buffer

Buffer name for this Helm session. `helm-buffer' will take this value.

*** :keymap

[Obsolete]

Keymap used at the start of this Helm session.

It is overridden by keymaps specified in sources, and is kept
only for backward compatibility.

Keymaps should be specified in sources using the :keymap slot
instead. See `helm-source'.

This keymap is not restored by `helm-resume'.

*** :default

Default value inserted into the minibuffer with
\\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element].

It can be a string or a list of strings, in this case
\\<minibuffer-local-map>\\[next-history-element] cycles through
the list items, starting with the first.

If nil, `thing-at-point' is used.

If `helm-maybe-use-default-as-input' is non-nil, display is
updated using this value if this value matches, otherwise it is
ignored. If :input is specified, it takes precedence on :default.

*** :history

Minibuffer input, by default, is pushed to `minibuffer-history'.

When an argument HISTORY is provided, input is pushed to
HISTORY. HISTORY should be a valid symbol.

*** :allow-nest

Allow running this Helm command in a running Helm session.

** Other keywords

Other keywords are interpreted as local variables of this Helm
session. The `helm-' prefix can be omitted. For example,

(helm :sources \\='helm-source-buffers-list
       :buffer \"*helm buffers*\"
       :candidate-number-limit 10)

Starts a Helm session with the variable
`helm-candidate-number-limit' set to 10.

** Backward compatibility

For backward compatibility, positional parameters are
supported:

(helm sources input prompt resume preselect
       buffer keymap default history allow-nest)

However, the use of non-keyword args is deprecated.

- COLLECTION can be a list, alist, vector, obarray or hash-table.
  For alists and hash-tables their car are use as real value of
  candidate unless ALISTP is non-nil.
  It can be also a function that receives three arguments:
  the values string, predicate and t. See `all-completions' for more details.

Keys description:

- TEST: A predicate called with one arg i.e candidate.

- INITIAL-INPUT: Same as input arg in `helm'.

- PRESELECT: See preselect arg of `helm'.

- DEFAULT: This option is used only for compatibility with regular
  Emacs `completing-read' (Same as DEFAULT arg of `completing-read').

- BUFFER: Name of helm-buffer.

- MUST-MATCH: Candidate selected must be one of COLLECTION.

- FUZZY: Enable fuzzy matching.

- REVERSE-HISTORY: When non--nil display history source after current
  source completion.

- REQUIRES-PATTERN: Same as helm attribute, default is 0.

- HISTORY: A symbol where each result will be saved.
  If not specified as a symbol an error will popup.
  When specified, all elements of HISTORY are displayed in
  a special source before or after COLLECTION according to REVERSE-HISTORY.
  The main difference with INPUT-HISTORY is that the result of the
  completion is saved whereas in INPUT-HISTORY it is the minibuffer
  contents which is saved when you exit.
  Don't use the same symbol for INPUT-HISTORY and HISTORY.
  NOTE: As mentionned above this has nothing to do with
  `minibuffer-history-variable', therefore if you want to save this
  history persistently, you will have to add this variable to the
  relevant variable of your favorite tool for persistent emacs session
  i.e. psession, desktop etc...

- RAW-HISTORY: When non-nil do not remove backslashs if some in
  HISTORY candidates.

- INPUT-HISTORY: A symbol. The minibuffer input history will be
  stored there, if nil or not provided, `minibuffer-history'
  will be used instead.  You can navigate in this history with
  `M-p' and `M-n'.
  Don't use the same symbol for INPUT-HISTORY and HISTORY.

- CASE-FOLD: Same as `helm-case-fold-search'.

- PERSISTENT-ACTION: A function called with one arg i.e candidate.

- PERSISTENT-HELP: A string to document PERSISTENT-ACTION.

- MODE-LINE: A string or list to display in mode line.
  Default is `helm-comp-read-mode-line'.

- KEYMAP: A keymap to use in this `helm-comp-read'.
  (the keymap will be shared with history source)

- NAME: The name related to this local source.

- HEADER-NAME: A function to alter NAME, see `helm'.

- EXEC-WHEN-ONLY-ONE: Bound `helm-execute-action-at-once-if-one'
  to non--nil. (possibles values are t or nil).

- VOLATILE: Use volatile attribute.

- SORT: A predicate to give to `sort' e.g `string-lessp'
  Use this only on small data as it is inefficient.
  If you want to sort faster add a sort function to
  FC-TRANSFORMER.
  Note that FUZZY when enabled is already providing a sort function.

- FC-TRANSFORMER: A `filtered-candidate-transformer' function
  or a list of functions.

- HIST-FC-TRANSFORMER: A `filtered-candidate-transformer'
  function for the history source.

- MARKED-CANDIDATES: If non-nil return candidate or marked candidates as a list.

- NOMARK: When non--nil don't allow marking candidates.

- ALISTP:
  When non-nil (default) pass the value of (DISPLAY . REAL)
  candidate in COLLECTION to action when COLLECTION is an alist or a
  hash-table, otherwise DISPLAY is always returned as result on exit,
  which is the default when using `completing-read'.
  See `helm-comp-read-get-candidates'.

- CANDIDATES-IN-BUFFER: when non--nil use a source build with
  `helm-source-in-buffer' which is much faster.
  Argument VOLATILE have no effect when CANDIDATES-IN-BUFFER is non--nil.

- GET-LINE: Specify the :get-line slot of `helm-source-in-buffer', has no effect
  when CANDIDATES-IN-BUFFER is nil.
 
- MATCH-PART: Allow matching only one part of candidate.
  See match-part documentation in `helm-source'.

- MATCH-DYNAMIC: See match-dynamic in `helm-source-sync'
  It has no effect when used with CANDIDATES-IN-BUFFER.

- ALLOW-NEST: Allow nesting this `helm-comp-read' in a helm session.
  See `helm'.

- MULTILINE: See multiline in `helm-source'.

- COERCE: See coerce in `helm-source'.

- RAW-CANDIDATE: Do not unquote the unknown candidate coming from helm-pattern
  when non nil. 

- GROUP: See group in `helm-source'.

Any prefix args passed during `helm-comp-read' invocation will be recorded
in `helm-current-prefix-arg', otherwise if prefix args were given before
`helm-comp-read' invocation, the value of `current-prefix-arg' will be used.
That means you can pass prefix args before or after calling a command
that use `helm-comp-read'.  See `helm-M-x' for example.

Define MAPS, optionally using DEFINER, in the keymap(s) corresponding to STATES
and KEYMAPS.

MAPS consists of paired keys (vectors or strings; also see
`general-implicit-kbd') and definitions (those mentioned in `define-key''s
docstring and general.el's \"extended\" definitions). All pairs (when not
ignored) will be recorded and can be later displayed with
`general-describe-keybindings'.

If DEFINER is specified, a custom key definer will be used to bind MAPS. See
general.el's documentation/README for more information.

Unlike with normal key definitions functions, the keymaps in KEYMAPS should be
quoted (this allows using the keymap name for other purposes, e.g. deferring
keybindings if the keymap symbol is not bound, optionally inferring the
corresponding major mode for a symbol by removing \"-map\" for :which-key,
easily storing the keymap name for use with `general-describe-keybindings',
etc.). Note that general.el provides other key definer macros that do not
require quoting keymaps.

STATES corresponds to the evil state(s) to bind the keys in. Non-evil users
should not set STATES. When STATES is non-nil, `evil-define-key*' will be
used (the evil auxiliary keymaps corresponding STATES and KEYMAPS will be used);
otherwise `define-key' will be used (unless DEFINER is specified). KEYMAPS
defaults to 'global. There is also 'local, which create buffer-local
keybindings for both evil and non-evil keybindings. There are other special,
user-alterable \"shorthand\" symbols for keymaps and states (see
`general-keymap-aliases' and `general-state-aliases').

Note that STATES and KEYMAPS can either be lists or single symbols. If any
keymap does not exist, those keybindings will be deferred until the keymap does
exist, so using `eval-after-load' is not necessary with this function.

PREFIX corresponds to a key to prefix keys in MAPS with and defaults to none. To
bind/unbind a key specified with PREFIX, \"\" can be specified as a key in
MAPS (e.g. ...:prefix \"SPC\" \"\" nil... will unbind space).

The keywords in this paragraph are only useful for evil users. If
NON-NORMAL-PREFIX is specified, this prefix will be used instead of PREFIX for
states in `general-non-normal-states' (e.g. the emacs and insert states). This
argument will only have an effect if one of these states is in STATES or if
corresponding global keymap (e.g. `evil-insert-state-map') is in KEYMAPS.
Alternatively, GLOBAL-PREFIX can be used with PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX to
bind keys in all states under the specified prefix. Like with NON-NORMAL-PREFIX,
GLOBAL-PREFIX will prevent PREFIX from applying to `general-non-normal-states'.
INFIX can be used to append a string to all of the specified prefixes. This is
potentially useful when you are using GLOBAL-PREFIX and/or NON-NORMAL-PREFIX so
that you can sandwich keys in between all the prefixes and the specified keys in
MAPS. This may be particularly useful if you are using default prefixes in a
wrapper function/macro so that you can add to them without needing to re-specify
all of them. If none of the other prefix keyword arguments are specified, INFIX
will have no effect.

If PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP is specified, a prefix command and/or keymap
will be created. PREFIX-NAME can be additionally specified to set the keymap
menu name/prompt. If PREFIX-COMMAND is specified, `define-prefix-command' will
be used. Otherwise, only a prefix keymap will be created. Previously created
prefix commands/keymaps will never be redefined/cleared. All prefixes (including
the INFIX key, if specified) will then be bound to PREFIX-COMMAND or PREFIX-MAP.
If the user did not specify any PREFIX or manually specify any KEYMAPS, general
will bind all MAPS in the prefix keymap corresponding to either PREFIX-MAP or
PREFIX-COMMAND instead of in the default keymap.

PREDICATE corresponds to a predicate to check to determine whether a definition
should be active (e.g. \":predicate '(eobp)\"). Definitions created with a
predicate will only be active when the predicate is true. When the predicate is
false, key lookup will continue to search for a match in lower-precedence
keymaps.

In addition to the normal definitions supported by `define-key', general.el also
provides \"extended\" definitions, which are plists containing the normal
definition as well as other keywords. For example, PREDICATE can be specified
globally or locally in an extended definition. New global (~general-define-key~)
and local (extended definition) keywords can be added by the user. See
`general-extended-def-keywords' and general.el's documentation/README for more
information.

PACKAGE is the global version of the extended definition keyword that specifies
the package a keymap is defined in (used for \"autoloading\" keymaps)

PROPERTIES, REPEAT, and JUMP are the global versions of the extended definition
keywords used for adding evil command properties to commands.

MAJOR-MODES, WK-MATCH-KEYS, WK-MATCH-BINDINGS, and WK-FULL-KEYS are the
corresponding global versions of which-key extended definition keywords. They
will only have an effect for extended definitions that specify :which-key or
:wk. See the section on extended definitions in the general.el
documentation/README for more information.

LISPY-PLIST and WORF-PLIST are the global versions of extended definition
keywords that are used for each corresponding custom DEFINER.

the first string, vector, or keyword are considered to be positional arguments.
This means that you cannot use a function or variable for a key that starts

`general-key' should be prefered over this whenever possible as it is simpler
and has saner functionality in many cases because it does not rely on
`unread-command-events' (e.g. \"C-h k\" will show the docstring of the command
to be simulated ; see the readme for more information). The main downsides of
`general-key' are that it cannot simulate a command followed by keys or
subsequent commands, and which-key does not currently work well with it when
simulating a prefix key/incomplete key sequence.

KEYS should be a string given in `kbd' notation. It can also be a list of a
single command followed by a string of the key(s) to simulate after calling that
command. STATE should only be specified by evil users and should be a quoted
evil state. KEYMAP should not be quoted. Both STATE and KEYMAP aliases are
supported (but they have to be set when the macro is expanded). When neither
STATE or KEYMAP are specified, the key(s) will be simulated in the current
context.

If NAME is specified, it will replace the automatically generated function name.
NAME should not be quoted. If DOCSTRING is specified, it will replace the
automatically generated docstring.

Normally the generated function will look up KEY in the correct context to try
to match a command. To prevent this lookup, LOOKUP can be specified as nil.
Generally, you will want to keep LOOKUP non-nil because this will allow checking
the evil repeat property of matched commands to determine whether or not they
should be recorded. See the docstring for `general--simulate-keys' for more
information about LOOKUP.

When a WHICH-KEY description is specified, it will replace the command name in
the which-key popup.

When a command name is specified and that command has been remapped (i.e. [remap
command] is currently bound), the remapped version will be used instead of the
original command unless REMAP is specified as nil (it is true by default).

The advantages of this over a keyboard macro are as follows:
- Prefix arguments are supported
- The user can control the context in which the keys are simulated
- The user can simulate both a named command and keys
- The user can simulate an incomplete key sequence (e.g. for a keymap)

MAPS consists of <key> <command> pairs. If a key in MAPS is matched, the
corresponding command will be run. Otherwise FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run with
the unmatched keys. So, for example, if \"ab\" was pressed, and \"ab\" is not
one of the key sequences from MAPS, the FALLBACK-COMMAND will be run followed by
the simulated keypresses of \"ab\". Prefix arguments will still work regardless
of which command is run. This is useful for binding under non-prefix keys. For
example, this can be used to redefine a sequence like \"cw\" or \"cow\" in evil
but still have \"c\" work as `evil-change'. If TIMEOUT is specified,
FALLBACK-COMMAND will also be run in the case that the user does not press the
next key within the TIMEOUT (e.g. 0.5).

NAME and DOCSTRING are optional keyword arguments. They can be used to replace
the automatically generated name and docstring for the created function. By
default, `cl-gensym' is used to prevent name clashes (e.g. allows the user to
create multiple different commands using `self-insert-command' as the
FALLBACK-COMMAND without explicitly specifying NAME to manually prevent
clashes).

When INHERIT-KEYMAP is specified, all the keybindings from that keymap will be
