#+TITLE: TODO for my org mode

* Apps
** Magit
** Rss
** Telega
** IMAP
* QOL:

** [ ] Diagnostics
inline + trouble (flymake / flycheck) + "show for the line"
** [ ] Lsp features
*** better code actions
test on jdtls 
*** + setup lsp servers:
1. c++
2. c
3. python
4. java
5. bash
6. rust - highlighting
 
Think about 
** [ ] line num Col. 
*** git status
*** better diagnostics showcase
** keymaps
+ deselect seach result
** theme
+ search results shuld be boxed

* Fix lsp-find-reference and projectile grep
* Navigation
** Persp quick access to sessions
- SPC n as mod
  + n -> notes
  + m -> main
  + h -> herb
  + t -> telega
  + etc
- if not created -> create + assign projectile there
** Indication
- Only current session name
* TMUX
Combine opening new persp session + starting new project. Every window should have a "root" of a terminal.
when you leave the last opened buffer, instead of closing emacs, you open terminal in its root.
** tabs: keep per session
** windows setup (eyebrowse) 
*** Main horizontal layout


* THEME
** LSP
- macro to cyan
- enum to macro
- go over lsp in general
- [ ] hover things (inof / help as reference + bars in vim)
- [ ] corfu
** Org
** Autocomplet
- better "matches" while searching by orderless
 
* Terminal integration
** Good fm
prob just go open fm (yazi) in the termnal via wm
** Tab integration:
- magit
- toggle-bable (fullscreen) zsh for each pesp session (in the root of the projectile)
- two add. terminals: one for build one for git (toogleble)

* General Dotfiles
- fix toggle-touchpad
- laucnh python hc helper
- have env for home/work
- hace preset with that for home / work
